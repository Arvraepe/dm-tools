He believes he’s an avatar for a god of death."," – Evil sorceress, raised by fairies and taught the way of wild magic. Her right hand, which she keeps locked in a cage, functions as a rod of wonder (roll on the table of random magical effects from Courtney Campbell).

Her friend is a fairy named Avalon who gives victims amnesia, sometimes to the point of them forgetting their own name."," – A golem experiment gone wrong, Telex is made entirely of candy and cookies. He looks normal, but after he takes damage in combat he will eat a part of his shoulder and regain all his health.

All he’s looking for in life is a place where he can sit outside and not get pecked at by the birds."," – A female dream merchant from the shores of your last nightmare. She’s real now, if you can believe it, and she’s selling your memories (or at least your memories in dream form). She’s very (insert your personality) and only wants (insert your goals).

On her head sets the crown of the Space Princess. It’s a simple steel band with three large space-diamonds (one on the front, one on each side). The space-glass is sentient and listens to the wearer of the band through laser commands. The headband fires infrared lasers that move the space-glass. She can stand on them and fly with them. They can shatter and carve through targets and then reform. She can have the laser reflect from a chunk of glass to blind target or do damage like a disintegration spell. What does she want? Probably something cute you have that goes with her ship."," – A knight from a poor family, daughter of the baron of a poor village, Klaura has traveled off to find riches. Every bit of gold she finds she sends back home. She sleeps outside of town or in the alley behind the bar. She gives up all for the betterment of her town. She’s a redhead with sunburnt skin and simple leather armor with a matching, battered shield. Her blade looks like shit and has been in her family for seventy generations, but a trained magical eye can see that it’s a blade of dragon slaying. Not only that but the first one ever crafted, making it the mother of all other dragon slaying blades. Needless to say it is worth more gold than a king could muster. As a sidekick, Klaura travels with a small light-fairy in a lantern. The fairy can only speak sylvan (which Klaura cannot). It knows of the blade and actually likes being kept in the lanters (it keeps her safe from the dragon that is trying to scry her to find the sword)."," – Spell-sword extraordinaire. A prodigy in both blade-mastery and in the sorcerous arts. Her icy blue hair is braided down her back and won’t be cut until she is bested.

She’s been touched by ice and her heart beats like the undead. Her rapier is imbued with liquid cold, which freezes opponents blades.

But she left that all behind, she swears, though she wears the best clothes and sleeps in the best inns, eats the best food, keeps herself well kept. She left it behind because Claus, her Dire Tiger animal companion (whom can speak) came to her one night saying he was sent from the Great Stag himself. Twirly is meant for greatness, he says. And now they travel. She sits on the fancy flying carpet that hangs over his back, and he wears a snow cap (the kind with the dangly fuzz balls) that allows him to resist fire damage. Secretly (or maybe not so secretly) Claus is in love with Twirly and wasn’t sent by the Great Stag, but banished by him. And Twirly gets gold sent from her family every week."," – A black-haired raven of a woman, stark black armor and blade. Her hawk sits upon her shoulder unless he’s scouter or sending messages. She’s on the hunt and could always use help. What’s she on the hunt for? Monsters. The biggest and baddest in the region. Why does she do it? Because she’s good at it. There’s nothing special about her other than the fact that she’s extremely lucky."," – A catfolk from a distant land, traveling with her dire korgi. She’s a simple kitten. She likes to fish and she likes to defeat her foes with honor and swiftness. She meditates on her death every morning and believes herself to be ready for death at all moments.

She’s not ready."," – An ex-druid who has become an assassin. She wears a black, marauder’s mask, black leather armor, and a dark-grey leather cloak. She wields a samurai sword and follows the insight granted to her from her crow familiar. She’s looking to kill the elf in your party and was payed a huge amount to follow through.

She’s a very sweet and innocent figure who rules with a quite brute force. Her staff, which is short handled with a large, glowing hornet’s nest on the end. She has control over the hornet’s in the hive (as many as d100 + 30 hornets) and they are all infused with a magical poison which affects people with random, wild magic effects."," – This samurai is dressed is a loose kimono and tight undershirt. She is like a succubus, except she’s not a demon. She sleeps with other warriors, essentially defeating them with her body. She smokes a magical pipe that she is immune to. When the smoke from the pipe is breathed it acts as a hallucinogenic. She likes to breath it into the faces of her challengers and then, when they freak out, she defeats them in combat and impregnates them with an idea. This idea grows uncontrollably, leaving the warriors helpless in a wallowing self-detriment."," – This sentient undead, dressed in a troubadour’s hat and matching revolutionary war regalia, wields a long-barreled riffle. Single shot. Insta-kill. He speaks in a slow, drawing tone and is seeking vengeance against the one who left him to die.

Then he’ll owe you the remainder of his undead life."," – A saint from a powerful church. He’s dressed in green, satin robes and wields an ancient spellbook that holds the secrets to a devious cult. He is strictly Lawful Good and is hunting down all the previous members of this cult.

He is unrestrained when he meets one of these people, and anyone who helps him in eliminating these people will be seen as a holy person in his eyes."," – Selling birds on the side of the road is a strange, short, fat man, with big bug eyes and a white, ratty beard. He dons a thin, red cloak and wears shitty, cloth clothes. He owns a bird of every species and feeds them as a mother bird would feed her children. He controls every bird, and even when he “sells one”, they steal all the gold they can and return to him the next night. He’s trying to either sell to the party or get them to free one of his birds that got imprisoned in a magical cage."," – Assassin. He’s an elongated orc with long hair, long beard, and a bandolier full of shuriken. He has gauntlets of steel claws on, and is otherwise naked. He rides the head of a decapitated demon. The head is as large as a sedan, and has three open eyes that fire rays (like a beholder). The head floats at twice the speed of normal human walking. The head can also devour medium and smaller creatures whole. His fee is 1,000,000gp per person, so whoever hired him to kill the party meant business."," – She’s a pikeman from the royal academy, looking to find an adventuring party that will accept her less-than-stellar scores. She’s very eager and well armed, but she’s very clumsy and not very silent. She talks a lot and never has anything interesting to say. But who knows, maybe, when the chips are down, she can pull out a clutch victory for the party. Or she can just fall in a pit and be forgotten."," – Graduate from the Altoris Hills Private Wizarding Academy. Everyone knows of that place. It’s the one that was attacked by a dragon. Body parts scattered as far as twenty miles from the slaughter. Everyone suspected dead. Thomlai was marked by constantly burning flesh up his back and eyes that drift back in time to that moment when the beast lifted his girlfriend high into the air and squished her like jelly between his fingers. Thomlai doesn’t want help fighting the dragon. And he doesn’t want help looking for the dragon. Everyone knows it rests on Altoris Hill inside the ruined academy. But he does want help finding a spell. It’s ancient. Druidic. Said to require a human sacrifice and a king’s head. Help him find it and he may let you tag along to pilfer the ruins."," – An attractive girl trained by her mother in witchcraft. She transforms into spiders as ofter as she can and wants more than anything to be a drider. She seeks out drow cults and caverns in the hopes of learning the secret ritual required by their matrons to become driders priestesses. If met on the road she’ll be singing a tune while digging the organs out of her last kill. She drinks blood, eats raw flesh, and does disgusting witch things, but always has a chipper smile."," – Elven, which means she’s cursed. Things around her disappear. They don’t die, they just cease to be seen or heard or felt or remembered. She likes this. She goes to places she does not like and she lets them all vanish. She will never vanish. She and her tall, red wizard hat will always exist and will always have someone to hate."," – Summoner of books. Wielder of hooked staff of silver and wood. Her boyish red hair is circled by a headband, and her fish-scale armor gleams like a moving sea.

He has d12+d4 imp-sized voodoo dolls that can take the form of any humanoid that Rupert sees, converses with, or wrongs him by starring too long into his empty eye sockets.

He’s a young lad who was raised from a stillbirth. He travels alone because those he travels with are cursed to become one of his doves (anyone sleeping in the same camp as the Dove Knight is attacked by a wight, and is slain by this wight you become one of his doves. The doves are made of light and hide as tattoos on the boy’s flesh. When he enters combat they fly from his skin and circle above. Whenever he is slain, a dove flies into his body and reconstructs it. And every time this happens, he learns from his defeat, giving him a +1 to combat rolls."," – A young girl who picked up her grandfather’s sword to protect her family. Her grandfather rose as a spirit to protect her, infusing his soul with the sword.

She needs people to lead or a village smart enough to listen to her. She is not a fighter, though she has a cursed blade on her back. She is not a lover, though she draws many eyes.
